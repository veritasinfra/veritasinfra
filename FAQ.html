            VERITAS is a compliance aware payments and payroll protocol on Solana.
            It provides a legal wrapper, KYC linked program derived accounts,
            a transaction logging pattern and an indexer, so that payroll, card
            and real world asset flows can be traced, audited and attached to
            real legal entities, while still running on public crypto rails.

            Today, on chain payroll and payments are fast, the audit trail often is not.
            Different wallets, ad hoc spreadsheets and scattered compliance records
            make it hard for businesses, auditors and regulators to understand what
            is really happening. VERITAS standardizes how KYC, legal entities and
            payment metadata are tied to programs and accounts, so that an audit
            can be completed in days instead of months.

            VERITAS at its core is a Solana based protocol, implemented through Anchor programs, PDAs and indexer infrastructure. A VERITAS Attestation Bond Token is a utility and governance asset around this protocol, required to underwrite the Legal Wrapper and other compliance configurations. It is used to signal responsibility and fund essential protocol functions and legal maintenance. Around that, a legal entity structure is expected to operate the open source work, manage partnerships and handle off chain obligations. The protocol itself is meant to be reusable by many different applications.

            VERITAS is built on Solana. The choice is driven by throughput, low fees and a mature
            developer stack through Anchor, SPL token standards and token extensions. Compliance
            aware payroll, card and RWA flows benefit from reliable, inexpensive transactions,
            since many small on chain writes are required for every period of activity.

            The legal wrapper has two sides. Off chain, a business or DAO forms or attaches to
            a legal entity, such as an LLC, a DAO LLC or a foundation, and completes KYC or KYB
            through a chosen provider. On chain, VERITAS creates configuration and legal PDAs
            that encode the relationship between that entity, its payroll flows and its card or
            RWA accounts. When payroll or card programs run, they record hashes and metadata into
            these PDAs, so that the chain itself reflects the legal context of each flow in a
            consistent and queryable way.

            The oracle layer is a pattern for writing verified, signed compliance and risk data
            into PDAs, for example KYC status, jurisdiction tags, or risk flags. The indexer scans
            blocks and program logs, listens for events such as transaction logs from VERITAS
            programs, and writes structured JSON views for reporting, dashboards and audits.
            Together, they bridge the gap between raw on chain logs and human readable compliance
            reports.

            No. VERITAS does not operate as a wallet, does not match orders like an exchange,
            and does not take deposits as a bank. Instead it is an infrastructure layer that
            other wallets, exchanges, payroll tools and card issuers can connect to, in order
            to associate their flows with a verifiable legal and compliance context.

            No. VERITAS is designed as compliance infrastructure. The VERITAS Attestation Bond Token is a mandatory utility primitive for protocol access and risk management, not an investment contract. It is required as collateral to underwrite regulated configurations (e.g., Legal Wrappers, payroll classifications) and is subject to slashing for non-compliance. It does not hold client funds, does not act as a broker or exchange, and does not promise yields or returns. Based on its functional design as a required bond for protocol access, VERITAS believes its token is not a security under U.S. law.

            The protocol does not store raw personal data on chain. Instead, KYC and KYB checks
            are expected to be performed by approved providers off chain. Results are turned into
            hashes or structured flags, then written to PDAs and oracle storage. That way, programs
            can enforce that a user or entity is verified, without exposing sensitive identity data
            in public state. Legal counsel in each region should guide how much data is written,
            and under what privacy framework.

            There are several categories of risk. Technical risk, the smart contracts or indexer
            code could contain bugs, so audits and staged rollouts are important. Regulatory risk,
            laws and guidance change, which can affect what is considered sufficient compliance.
            Integration risk, partners and third party services may fail or change behavior.
            Market risk, cryptographic assets remain volatile and subject to market stress.
            VERITAS aims to make these risks visible and manageable, but cannot remove them.

            No. VERITAS is a tool that makes it easier for legal teams and regulators to see and
            understand on chain activity. It will always remain the responsibility of each
            business or DAO to obtain legal advice, follow local rules and work with regulators
            where needed. The protocol is meant to reduce friction and ambiguity, not to remove
            oversight.

            The project is positioned in an early builder and grant ready phase. The whitepaper, architecture, and an Anchor based demo of the legal wrapper, KYC PDAs, transaction logging and indexer pattern are the focus. The intent is to secure grants and partnerships, and rapidly move through audited milestones toward production grade infrastructure, with the goal of transferring core protocol control to the decentralized DAO multi-sig within the first 15 months. The intent is to secure grants and partnerships, then move through structured milestones toward production grade infrastructure and real world integrations.

            The near focus includes: refining and shipping the full devnet demo, legal wrapper
            plus oracle plus indexer, securing grant and research support, onboarding early
            design partners that want to test payroll and card flows, and preparing audits,
            compliance reviews and a safer production roadmap. Longer term, the intent is to
            become the default compliance layer for serious Solana based business payment flows.

            Builders can participate by reviewing the whitepaper, testing the demo once it is
            live on devnet, and proposing concrete integrations where a VERITAS legal and audit
            layer can help them win enterprise or institutional users. Legal and compliance
            partners can help shape the wrapper for different regions, and grant bodies can
            support the open source work so the protocol reaches production strength without
            depending on aggressive token speculation.
